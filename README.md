# 📈 Stock Price Predictor

A deep learning-powered web application that predicts stock prices using LSTM models. Built with **Streamlit**, **PyTorch**, and **Plotly**, this project allows users to train models with historical stock data and make future price predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- **Train LSTM Models**: Train a stock price prediction model using a custom CSV file or a Kaggle dataset.
- **Interactive Candlestick Charts**: Visualize stock price movements with dynamic **Plotly** charts.
- **Predict Future Prices**: Load a trained model and forecast the next closing price.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures CSV files contain the necessary stock price columns before training or prediction.
